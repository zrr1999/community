# Github Management

GitHub is widely used by PaddlePaddle project to store and organize code, manage issues and documents, and provide a consistent contributor process.

As PaddlePaddle project grows in size, managing GitHub's footprint has been a challenge. We have many policies in place to reduce friction and simplify the management of GitHub repositories and organizations. We have also created a number of tools to automatically set and enforce these policies.

## Core Repository

The core repository is considered the core projects of PaddlePaddle. They are utilities, tools, applications, or libraries that are related to PaddlePaddle eco-system. 

### Objectives

Create a broader base than the existing PaddlePaddle projects so that the new project can be expanded. Current expectations for the centrality and importance of the library in the PaddlePaddle ecosystem. Recognized by the PaddlePaddle community.

### Rules

* Must exist in github.com/PaddlePaddle/<project name>
* New repository must adopt the code of conduct
* All code projects use Apache license version 2.0
* Repository must be approved by TOC
