# PaddlePaddle Open Governance

## Overall Purpose

While expanding PaddlePaddle's technical landscape and increasing user community contributions, PaddlePaddle also maintains its integrity and improves the quality of contributions.

## Specific Target

- Clarify the relationship between the project, PaddlePaddle project personnel and community contributors.
- Attract more community participation and create an effective TOC contribution and recognition portal.
- While reducing the workload of the TOC on certain projects, retaining the executive control and integrity of the agency.
- Avoid establishing political platforms between vendors.
- Strengthen the project ecosystem to meet the needs of end users and project contributors.
- Identify gaps in the PaddlePaddle project portfolio, find and attract projects to fill these gaps.
- Educate and guide users to provide users with unbiased, effective and practical information.
- Focus attention and resources on promoting the maturity of the PaddlePaddle project.

## Introduction

PPSIG will supervise and coordinate the interests related to the logical areas of end users and/or project requirements. Usually a group of PaddlePaddle projects meets the domain of PPSIG supervision, or it may be a cross-domain feature group shared by multiple projects (such as security and observability). 

PPSIG is:

- A long-standing group, reporting to the Technical Oversight Committee TOC.
- Mainly led by recognized experts in related fields and supported by other contributors.

TOC is:

- The technical management organization of PaddlePaddle organization. It recognizes and supervises all projects under the PaddlePaddle organization and authorizes the promotion of a neutral consensus.
- Define and maintain the technical vision of PaddlePaddle deep learning ecology.
- Approve new projects within the scope of PaddlePaddle specified by the Board of Directors (GB), and create a conceptual framework for the project, adjust the project, delete or archive the project.
- Accept feedback from the end user committee and map it to the project.
- Align the interface with the components under management (the code reference implementation before standardization), and define common practices (if any) to be implemented in the PaddlePaddle project.

## PaddlePaddle SIG's responsibilities and rights

Under the guidance of TOC, PPSIG provides high-quality professional technical knowledge, unbiased information and leadership in the field. As an informed party and an efficient executive committee, TOC uses this input to select and promote appropriate PaddlePaddle projects and practices, and disseminate high-quality information to end users and the community.

PPSIG should strive to provide the TOC with a “proposition” that is easy to understand and voteable, and the proposal needs to be supported by clear documentary evidence. These proposals can be: "based on written due diligence" or "approval of the landscape document based on clear goals and evidence." The information and advice provided by PaddlePaddle SIG to the TOC must be highly accurate and fair, which is very important. This is also driven by the goal of improving PaddlePaddle as a whole, rather than benefiting one project or company from other projects or companies.

The reason for this design is to consider:

- PaddlePaddle TOC is the arbitrator and writer, and may always intervene and reject proposals.
- PaddlePaddle SIG is a respected talented group.

PPSIG can choose to form a time-limited centralized working group to fulfill certain responsibilities (for example, making specific educational white papers or combined blank analysis reports). The working group WG should have a clearly documented charter, timetable (usually a few quarters at most) and a set of deliverables. Once the timetable passes or the results are delivered, the working group will be dissolved and reorganized.

### Specific PaddlePaddle SIG responsibilities

#### Project handling:

- Understand and record the high-level roadmap of projects in this field, including PaddlePaddle and non-PaddlePaddle projects. Identify gaps in the project prospects.
- For PaddlePaddle projects, perform a health check.
- Discover and exhibit pairs of candidate projects.
- Help candidate projects prepare for submission to TOC.
- Each PaddlePaddle project will be assigned to an appropriate PPSIG by TOC.

#### End user education

- Provide the latest, high-quality, unbiased and easy-to-use materials to help end users understand and effectively adopt cloud native technologies and practices in the PPSIG field, such as:
  - White papers, presentations, videos or other forms of training, clarification of terminology, comparison of different methods, available projects or products, common or recommended practices, trends, illustrative successes and failures, etc.
  - Information should be collected based on research and facts as much as possible, rather than pure marketing or speculation.

#### End user input collection

- Collect useful end user input and feedback on expectations, pain points, main use cases, etc.
- Compile it into easy-to-use reports and/or presentations to help the project with functional design, prioritization, UX, etc.

#### Community Support

- PPSIG is an open organization that provides meetings, meeting agendas and notes, mailing lists and other public communications.
- The PPSIG mailing list, PPSIG meeting calendar and other communication documents will be publicly released and maintained.

#### As a trusted expert advisor for TOC

- Conduct technical due diligence on new projects and graduation projects, and make recommendations to TOC on the results of the investigation.
- Participate in or regularly check projects in their field, and provide TOC with recommendations on health, status and measures (if any) as needed or upon request.

#### PaddlePaddle SIG Charter:

- Formally reviewed annually and approved by TOC. The charter must clearly state:
  - Which are within the scope of the PPSIG and which are not;
  - Communicate with other PaddlePaddle PPSIG or other related groups to clarify whether there is overlap;
  - How to operate and manage, whether and how to deviate from the standard PPSIG operating guidelines provided by TOC. Deviations from these guidelines are discouraged unless there is a well-documented reason for this disagreement approved by the TOC.

## Operation Model

Important note: Each PPSIG is supported by a designated member of PaddlePaddle's executive staff, who is responsible for liaison with the head of PaddlePaddle, communication and performance of the PPSIG, and submit quarterly and annual reports to the Board of Directors BD and TOC.

### PaddlePaddle SIG formation, leadership and membership

1. PPSIG is formed by TOC. The initial PPSIG is listed below and will be adjusted over time as needed. If community members think that additional PPSIG needs to be added, they should raise it to TOC and give a clear reason. It is best to have volunteers lead the PPSIG. TOC wants to have the smallest number of feasible PPSIGs, and all PPSIGs are efficient.

2. The PPSIG has three co-chairs who are TOC contributors, recognized experts in the field, and have the ability to co-lead the PPSIG to generate unbiased information.

3. The PPSIG has a TOC liaison who serves as a voting member of the TOC and acts as an additional non-executive chairman when the TOC or PPSIG chairman deems it necessary to submit the TOC.

4. PPSIG has a number of technical leaders who are recognized as (1) experts in the PPSIG field, (2) project leaders in the PPSIG field, and (3) demonstrated the balancing techniques needed to provide unbiased information needed to generate PPSIG leadership. The main reason for adopting the role of independent chairman and technical director is to separate the responsibilities of administrative functions from the deep technical functions and related time commitments and skill sets. Under appropriate circumstances, individuals can perform both roles at the same time (see below).

5. Strongly encourage diversity of ideas and interests within PPSIG.

6. PPSIG members are appointed by themselves, so some SIG work is done by TOC contributors and community volunteers. In order to identify members who have made continuous and valuable contributions to the PPSIG over time, roles defined and assigned by the PPSIG can be created (for example, training or document coordinator, etc.). The PPSIG should record what these roles and responsibilities are, who is the performer, and have the PPSIG leader approve.

### PaddlePaddle SIG Life Cycle

#### Research and consultation

Proposers of the PPSIG should consider the following questions:

* A clearly defined problem or set of problems that the group can solve.
* Consult with the beneficiary community members to assess their interests and willingness to commit.
* For existing projects, contributors’ concerns and corresponding Pull Reuest evidence.
* Potential goals to be achieved by the team.
* The resource requirements of the operation group.

#### Create a new group

The new team should follow the following procedures for licensing, the following are the specific requirements:

* The clear purpose and advantages of the new group (around sub-projects or application areas)
* Two or more contributors who are willing to act as the team leader, the existence of other contributors and evidence of team needs
* Resources required initially (usually mailing lists)
* The approval of this group will be determined by the TOC team.
* Promote the new PPSIG through discussion groups and PaddlePaddle website

#### Group Operations

Teams should choose to use collaboration to conduct meetings through scheduled conference calls or chat channels. Any such meetings should be advertised on the mailing list, and then comments should be posted on the mailing list. Regular meetings help advance the accountability and SIG progress. Members of the PaddlePaddle community team will actively monitor and encourage the group to conduct appropriate discussions.


### PaddlePaddle SIG member role

#### Chairman

- Three event seats rotating weekly/bi-weekly/monthly.
- Mainly perform management functions, including collecting and compiling weekly (bi-weekly) agenda topics, presiding over meetings, ensuring the release of high-quality meeting minutes, and tracking and solving follow-up actions.
- If someone has the time and ability to perform these two roles at the same time, as long as the TOC and PPSIG members are satisfied, they can be performed by the technical director.

#### Technical director

- Leading PPSIG projects.
- Is there time and ability to conduct in-depth technical exploration of the project. Projects may include formal PaddlePaddle projects or other projects in the areas covered by the PPSIG.

#### Other named roles

- Named and defined by PPSIG (e.g. public relations supervisor, document/training supervisor, etc.)
- Approved by the vast majority of chairpersons.

#### Other members

- Self-appointment
- There may be no clear roles or responsibilities, and no officially assigned roles (see above).
- Except for the designated roles, the public should not be given the impression that they have any authority or formal responsibilities in the PPSIG.

### Election

- TOC nominates the chairman
- After a 2/3 majority vote of the TOC, the chairperson was assigned
- Two-year term but staggered so that at least one seat can maintain continuity
- TOC and the chairman nominate technical director
- The technical director needs to obtain a 2/3 majority of the TOC and a 2/3 majority of the PPSIG chairman
- After obtaining a 2/3 majority vote of the TOC, the PPSIG chairman and technical director can be cancelled at any time

### Governance

- All PPSIGs inherit and follow PaddlePaddle TOC operating principles.
- The PPSIG must have a documented governance process that encourages community participation and clear guidelines to avoid biased decisions.
  -Note: The goal here is to be consistent with the "minimum feasible" model of the PaddlePaddle project, and only need such governance, not any overly cumbersome things
- If they conform to the operating principles of PaddlePaddle, they may gradually implement a series of practices over time, just like the OSS project.
- Like the PaddlePaddle project, all exceptions and disputes are handled by TOC and PaddlePaddle staff with help

### Budget and resources

- There is no formal system budget at this time, except for PaddlePaddle executives who promise to provide designated personnel as contact points.
- Just as the PaddlePaddle project may need "help" provided by PaddlePaddle, PPSIG can request corresponding resources through the PaddlePaddle Liaison Office.

## Retire

- In the event that PPSIG is unable to establish and perform duties and/or regularly report to TOC, TOC will:
  - Consider disbanding (retire) PPSIG after 3 months
  - PPSIG must be dissolved after 6 months
- TOC can pass the "no confidence" of PPSIG with a 2/3 majority vote. In this case, the TOC can vote to dissolve or reorganize the PPSIG.

## Initial PaddlePaddle SIG

To begin the process, TOC proposes the following PPSIGs and the items assigned to each PPSIG. Obviously, all of these PPSIGs will not be fully formed overnight or immediately begin to operate, so the TOC itself will perform the duties of the unformed PPSIG until the PPSIG is formed. However, we can immediately designate a voting member of the TOC as the liaison for each SIG, and give priority to the order of formation of the PPSIG, starting with the most urgent PPSIG immediately.

TOC and PaddlePaddle staff will work together to draft a set of the above-mentioned preliminary charter and collect/election suitable seats.
